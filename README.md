Lobster Detection Mobile Application - CSCIX691 Summer 2021 - Dalhousie University
Background
Team Members:
Kanak Prajapati
Kayleen Sung
Liam Cormack
Liam Osler
Pulkit Garg
Shawn Shahin Azar
Project Requirements:
Detection of whether there is a lobster in the camera view with a generally accessible and aesthetically pleasing app.

Proposed Solution:
Collect a proper dataset of lobster photos.
Label Images in CVAT or Roboflow Annotate.
Export annotated data set to Darknet YOLOv4.
Run dataset through roboflow training module.
Export our trained images and bounding boxes in the YOLO Darknet format, using Roboflow.
Convert YOLOv4 to TFliteâ€™s weighted system.
Write code to sort data from the API.
Convert Darknet Model to TensorFlow Lite.
Deploy on Device.
